Change log for HawkVoiceDI

Version 0.91 beta
Fixed bug in hcryptNewKey
Fixed struct defines in lpc10.h so that it can be used in C++ projects
Added hcryptSignPacket and hcryptAuthenticatePacket

Modified hcryptNewSalt to increase randomness
Added variable bit rate LPC-10 (VBR-LPC-10) codec


Version 0.9 beta
Updated hvdiNewVOX and hvdiVOX to eliminate most floating point calculations so
  that VOX is now suitable to use on StrongArm and other embedded CPUs

  also four times faster on Pentium class CPUs
Added HVDI_AUTO_VOX hint to enable internal VOX processing
Added HVDI_VOX_LEVEL and HVDI_VOX_SPEED hints to control HVDI_AUTO_VOX settings
Added HVDI_COMFORT_NOISE hint to create silence packets and generate comfort noise
Added HVDI_NOISE_LEVEL hint to set comfort noise level/volume
Updated hvdiNewEncryptionKey to slow down cracking attempts
Added hvdiNewEncryptionSalt and hvdiDeleteEncryptionSalt
Changed hvdiNewEncryptionKey so that it uses an optional salt value when creating the key
Split LPC codec into two source files, encoder and decoder
Added more tests to hvdiPacketIsVoice
Cleaned up u-law codec, now only one source file
Cleaned up GSM, now only three source files
Changed license of LPC-10 and GSM to LGPL
Split off encryption functions into a separate library, see hcrypt.h
Renamed encryption functions to have hcrypt* prefixes


Version 0.85 beta
Major cleanup of LPC-10 code; reduced to encoder and decoder source files

Reduced the number of potential codecs from a max of 127 to a max of 63
Removed extra 2 byte overhead added by encoders but no longer used
Updated test.c to exercise the CELP codec


Version 0.84 beta
Fixed bug in OpenLPC encoder where some codec state variables were not updated
Changed license of CELP and LPC to LGPL
Fixed Linux compile for codectest.c and test.c
Updated ftol.h file to be more portable
Cleaned up code for GCC 3.2
Fixed sequence wrapping problem in hvdiPacketDecode
Added celp_set_encoder_option to CELP encoder
More CELP encoder improvements to speed up code
Ported codectest.c to Unicode and WinCE


Version 0.83 beta
Fixed memory corruption in CELP codec
Fixed init problem in OpenLPC codec
Cleaned up code for MacOS X
Fixed compiler optimization bug in rate.c


Version 0.82 beta
Fixed multiline macro problems with some versions of GCC


Version 0.81 beta
New Linux makefile
Eliminated Linux compile warnings in source files
Modified codectest.c to add more error checking when opening .au source file
Modified codectest.c and test.c to remove need for nl.h file from HawkNL


Version 0.8 beta patch 1
Fixed hvdiNewRate, source file was not renamed properly
Fixed potential overflow problem with the unsigned short packet sequence number


Version 0.8 beta
Added CELP 4.8 Kbps codec
Optimised and cleaned up CELP code
Reduced CELP bit rate to 4.5 Kbps
Added CELP 3.0 and 2.3 Kbps options
Added CELP codebook length option to reduce the encoding CPU requirements as needed
  with a gradual reduction in speech quality
Increased the number of potential codecs from a max of 7 to a max of 127
Renamed hvdiAGCInit to hvdiNewAGC
Added hvdiDeleteAGC
Renamed hvdiCreateEncoderState to hvdiNewEncoderState, hvdiCreateDecoderState to hvdiNewDecoderState,
  hvdiFreeEncoderState to hvdiDeleteEncoderState, and hvdiFreeDecoderState to hvdiDeleteDecoderState
Changed BF_KEY to native hvdi_key structure
Renamed hvdiMakeEncryptionKey to hvdiNewEncryptionKey
Added hvdiDeleteEncryptionKey
Renamed hvdiIsVoicePacket to hvdiPacketIsVoice, hvdiDecodePacket to hvdiPacketDecode,
  and hvdiEncodePacket to hvdiPacketEncode
Added hvdiDecStateGetCodec
Renamed hvdiRateInit to hvdiNewRate
Added hvdiDeleteRate
Added hvdiNewVOX and hvdiDeleteVOX
Changed hvdiVOX argument order
Added hvdiHint


Version 0.71 beta
Modified ADPCM to increase performance, encode and decode time reduced by 17%
Cleaned up GSM code.
Modified GSM to increase performance, encode time reduced by 54%, decode reduced by 74%!
Enabled 'LTP_CUT' option for GSM encoding, 'LTP_CUT' reduces encode time by another 43%, or
  74% reduced time compared to version 0.7!
Wrapped all the include files for C++ compilers
Fixed LPC-10 bug that was reducing the voice quality
Cleaned up LPC-10 source code; minor 7% reduction in encode and decode time


Version 0.7 beta
Added the new OpenLPC codec that supports 1.4 and 1.8 Kbps
Modified the LPC codec to encode at 4.8 Kbps (12 bytes/frame). It was actually encoding
  at 5.2 Kbps (13 bytes/frame)
Modified codectest.c (on Windows) to profile the codecs more accurately
Modified the LPC codec to increase the performance. Reduced encode time by 12%, and
  decode time by 41%!!
Added hvdiVOX to enable voice activated transmission
Added sample rate conversion functions, hvdiRateInit and hvdiRateFlow
Added AGC (automatic gain control) functions, hvdiAGCInit and hvdiAGC
Added hvdiMix mixer function


Version 0.6 alpha
Renamed two GSM source files to avoid name conflicts with other codecs
Added test.c to exercise the API
Modified hvdiSetCodec to return the codec frame size instead of just a NLboolean
Removed dependence on HawkNL nl.h file


Version 0.5 alpha
Initial version, split off from HawkVoice
